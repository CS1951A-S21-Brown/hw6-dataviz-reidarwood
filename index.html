        <h1>Written Questions:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                My dashboard consists of 3 graphs, one generally used to answer
                each question. The first graph that I made was a simple bar chart
                very similar to the ones that we dd in lab that shows the top video 
                games by global sales. This firstly does it for all time data,
                but there is also the option to select by year and view the top
                games of a certain year. This uses a dropdown that is dynamically
                constructed using the data provided on page load.

                The second graph is a heatmap which shows genre sales by region.
                Retrospectively, I don't think that this was the wisest decision
                since sales in North America are much higher than other locations
                so are much brighter in the heatmap. However there is also a tooltip
                when hovering over a box that allows to remedy this.

                Lastly, my third graph shows the top publishers overall, and then
                can also look at top publishers in a certain genre. I chose a 
                barplot to show this again, because I thought that it would
                be the best way to show how good a publisher is based on how 
                I quantified publishers (average sales of all video games produced).
            </li>
            <li>
                D3 is really nice and really pretty which is probably the best thing
                that it did for my data Visualization. Additionally, it has a lot of
                flexibility, and you can show a lot of different types of graphs.

                Additionally, in general it is pretty accessable with regards
                to responsive data Visualization. People typically have a
                browser and can use that to view the data without downloading
                other software (such as needing to download python). So People
                can see the Visualization without downloading anything.

                Lastly, it handles a lot of the things like asyncronous calls
                to a server, and such without needing to write http requests
                and such. So it allows the use to be easier with nice library
                functions without needing to hard code.
            </li>
            <li>
                D3 might not always be the best thing to use however. If you are working
                with data in pandas in python, it might be easier to use python libraries
                like matplotlib so there is no need to save the file in a intermediary
                state like csv before showing in D3.

                Additionally, it is more time intensive than some other libraries. 
                So it may not be the best thing to use if you are planning on
                doing a static plot, or a rather simple Visualization. If that is
                the case, then there are other libraries in many languages that
                allow for a bar plot to be created much quicker.

                Lastly, it is fairly verbose for the result in simple cases. Creating
                a bar plot requires close to 100 lines of code, when in python if you
                read a csv with pandas, you can produce a simple histogram in less than
                5 lines of code.
            </li>
            <li>
                I think that people with vision problems, specifically blindness would
                have a difficult time with my dashboard. Even though I planned on
                creating alt text for my charts, I didn't have time to dynamically render
                the alt text, so was unable to do that for my charts. Since my charts are
                dynamic, the alt text would also need to be dynameic. In the first reading
                on blindness, and how to include alt text is what guided me here. Additionally,
                colorblind people might have an issue with my third chart since the colors that
                I used were red and green. However, color is not necessary for interpreting the chart,
                so it is not world breaking on choices of color.
            </li>

            <li>
                I could have planned more ahead, and gave myself more time to create the alt text.
                That was the main cause that led me to not be as verbose, and legible for 
                people with seeing disabilities. Additionally, I could have chosen better colors
                than red and green for my chart on genres, but chose those since usually means
                good and bad, and that is what I was trying to show. I couldn't really Choose
                other colors, and feel like I was providing the same experience, and felt that 
                the included text that I had were enough. Retrospectively, this doesn't provide the same
                experience to able, and disabled people, and is probably not the most effective color 
                choices that I could have made.
